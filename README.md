# HVcMO

Hill-Valley-Clustering-based Variable Mesh Optimization (HVcMO) is an instance of VMO-N, the multimodal optimization framework for the VMO metaheuristic. All of them are described in:

Navarro R. and Kim C.H., "Niching Multimodal Landscapes Faster yet Effectively: VMO and HillVallEA Benefit Together", 2020.

# HillVallEA

At the same time, HVcMO is an extension of HillVallEA19, the ultimate version of the HillVallEA scheme, detailed in:
